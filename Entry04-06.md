- What did you do in the last week?

Worked on AddBadge.php. Tried some approaches to database interaction that added and removed new types of badges. Also fixing code commends from code reviews and reviewing some code on the side.

- Are there any barriers to your goals?

The team hasn't figured out a way for us to upload images to use internally for badges, so we need to work on that (a pretty special case for this project).

- What do you plan to accomplish for next week?

Continue working on AddBadge.php and test that the database interaction is going smoothly, after that try to move on to assign badges or visualize them. Or figure out the png uploading problem.
