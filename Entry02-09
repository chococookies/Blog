Open Academy Report
- Day1: We met with our team mentors. The structure of mediawiki and the workings of how the wikimedia foundation worked.
This included their development environments, their code review structure and explanations on several mediawiki concepts including the classes of the mediawiki code base, some details about php, and some basics on localizatioin.
One of our mentors was there for about two hours before leaving us for the rest of the weekend. We kept a good relationship with Tyler, our other mentor.
We also familiarized ourselves with the Facebook snacking environment, not bad.

- Day2: Most of the day was spent tackling diverse technical issues, from both me and my teammates. The setup of the multiple tools was long and painful, but at the end of the day I could create my own mediawiki instance (others were aided by a virtual machine, so I was a bit into uncharted territory) there were a lot of bugs to flesh out. I also looked through the code of Persona, an authentication extension of MediaWiki related to our project. It was a good starting point to review some aspects of MediaWiki.

- Day3: With my mediawiki instance finally up and running, I familiarized myself with the concept of a Special page, which is our first task if we want to complete OpenBadges. I created a very simple one for that day. We laid foundations for communication and ordered future tasks chronologically. This was basically framework to prepare ourselves to be physically separated.
We were in less isolated rooms in facebook this time. It was more interesting and we got a chance to take pictures, record a video of our project, and say goodbyes before we went back to the monotony of everyday life. Thanks for organizing this. I learned a great amount, and I plan to keep learning.
