- What did you do in the last week?
- 
Slow week as we found a lot of our members were out on spring break on different weeks so it was hard to communicate. I went over code reviews from new contributors to the project, and started writing apatch that amends the suggestions. Some are automated tests, that require the code to comply with mediawiki coding standards. Others are suggestions from completely new people, so that is a new experience to me, and something common in open source.

- Are there any barriers to your goals?
- 
Have to meet up with my teammates sometime later this week.

- What do you plan to accomplish for next week?
- 
Push the code review changes, and continue adding the template for new management pages. When that is done hook it up to the database (which requires some special coding) and try to test it out with dummy badges if possible.
