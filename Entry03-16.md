- What did you do in the last week?
- 
Slow week as we found a lot of our members were out on spring break on different weeks so it was hard to communicate. I went over code reviews from new contributors to the project, and started writing apatch that amends the suggestions.

- Are there any barriers to your goals?
- 
No

- What do you plan to accomplish for next week?
- 
Push the code review changes, and continue adding the template for new management pages.
