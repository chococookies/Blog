- What did you do in the last week?
- 
Finalized three template special management for badgse. One adds new badges, another assigns badges to users, and the last one is where the badges for a user can be displayed (to later evolve into your own badge backback).

- Are there any barriers to your goals?
- 
The team hasn't figured out a way for us to upload images to sue internally for badges, so we need to work on that before we can actually use png's.

- What do you plan to accomplish for next week?
- 
Fix a wide range of code review issues that recently came in. Fix and enhance the templates so that they're compatible with internationalization. This requires rewriting the form printouts and updating the list of translatable keys.
