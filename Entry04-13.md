    What did you do in the last week?

Researched a bug in OpenBadges.php where our database would fail to load. Apparently there's something in the local environment I haven't realized that allows me better access to a database. Also some code review fixes in general, mostly involving internationalization and formatting issues.

    Are there any barriers to your goals?

Database management seems to conflict in my local environment vs the regular development environment.

    What do you plan to accomplish for next week?

Fix database interaction so we can get a visualization page up and running.
