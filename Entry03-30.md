- What did you do in the last week?
- 
Fix a wide range of code review issues including whitespace/tabbing to comply with mediawiki's coding standards. Fix and enhanced the test messages to contain internationalization, as opposed to using just english words. This was updated for the entire prototype of special pages.

- Are there any barriers to your goals?
- 
The team hasn't figured out a way for us to upload images to sue internally for badges, so we need to work on that before we can actually use png's.

- What do you plan to accomplish for next week?
- 
Going to work on AddBadge.php. The first most important part for badge-database interaciton, which allows the user to describe a new type/name of badge to add to the database.
