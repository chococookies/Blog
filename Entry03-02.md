- What did you do in the last week?
- 
Reviewed the database schema. Now that we have a nearly completed schema, I moved on to working on a front end for users to interact with the database. This involved starting some php special pages from scratch. The tasks needed for the semester involve 3 high level functions: badge assigning to a user, badge creation/image upload, and a page for a user to consult the badges that user currently has. I mostly laid out the high level design of our classes, this way we have a starting point for others to fill in.

- Are there any barriers to your goals?
- 
Some classes might need to be rewritten pending unexpected limitations on badges.

- What do you plan to accomplish for next week?
- 
Code reviews, and continue editing the high level design of our classes to fit our needs, and fill in some basic database functionality for one of the three pages, and research image uploading to create badges.
