    What did you do in the last week?
    
Work on AddBadges was completed mostly and it's now in debugging phase. We fixed a permissions error on the file uploads, slightly modified the db schema, and I am working to make sure it meets mediawiki internationalization standards.

    Are there any barriers to your goals?

No.

    What do you plan to accomplish for next week?

Make sure internationalization and grammar/vocabulary for the front end is according to mediawiki standards and merge the code base form our northern counterparts. +Code reviews and test AddBadges.php.
