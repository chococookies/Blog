    What did you do in the last week?
    
Database interaction was figured out earlier this week so we kept on moving with AddBadges.php. The problem we faced was that in order to have a working badge, we require png images. Uploading images from our own pages required looking into an upload wizard that we looked into but it caused additional problems. We settled on using the mediawiki built in image facility and just require the user to upload separately as opposed to having our own upload wizard (for now, to not invest much time in that).

    Are there any barriers to your goals?

No. Although we do need some art for badges.

    What do you plan to accomplish for next week?

Make sure we're adding badges correctly and the schema for the database holds our badges in the correct Mozilla spec.
